Will Lucy unlock the secrets of the fully operational human mind?", "Lucy, a young American woman living in Taipei, knows that she's in trouble when her casual boyfriend of a few weeks, Richard, a man she doesn't really know well, handcuffs a locked briefcase, contents unknown, to her wrist, forcing her to deliver it to a Mr. Jang in his swanky hotel suite. A scared Lucy quickly learns that Mr. Jang is a drug kingpin who is not averse to killing anyone in carrying out his work. That encounter with Mr. Jang leads to Lucy being forced to act as one of his drug mules, specifically of a powerful, synthetic drug called CPH4. Things start to change for Lucy when she inadvertently absorbs a high dose of CPH4 into her system, leading to several physiological changes to her self, most notably in that she begins to use more and more of her cerebral matter than the usual ten percent of most humans. As Lucy becomes more and more aware of everything around her - a result of the drug - she embarks on two concurrent paths, one being to get back at Mr. Jang and his associates for what they've done to her, including the torture they've inflicted on her. But the other path may trump the first, that second path which includes retrieving the CPH4 from the three other drug mules. It also involves Dr. Samuel Norman, arguably the foremost evolutionary theorist, and Paris Police Captain Pierre Del Rio, the later her touchstone to humanity, that need for a touchstone which becomes more and more important as she approaches her end goal."]}, {"movie_id": "tt2908446", "movie_title": "The Divergent Series: Insurgent", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxOTYxMTg3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgyMzA2NDE@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["Beatrice Prior must confront her inner demons and continue her fight against a powerful alliance which threatens to tear her society apart with the help from others on her side.", "As she searches for allies and answers in the wake of the uprising, Tris and Four are on the run.

Claire suspects that Eric may hold all the answers and becomes determined to uncover the truth, no matter the consequences.", "Dr. Claire Summers, a therapist, has lived her life within a small comfort zone without taking any risks. It is because of that life that her mentor Perry, to get her out of that comfort zone, assigns her to act as the group therapist for a handful of airplane crash survivors, that handful out of just over one hundred passengers who did not survive the crash. Perry warns her especially about one survivor, Eric Clark, who, instead of grief, feels ecstatic about life. Indeed, Eric does not want to attend group sessions along with the others, but he does encourage Claire to come see him anytime as a friend in his personal interest in her. On the caveat that he no longer hit on her, Claire decides to do so in her effort to help him. As such, she has to tread that fine line of acting but not acting as his therapist while he still has that attraction to her. Her ulterior motive in seeing Eric is that he, without coming right out and saying so or why, seems to know small details of her personal life. In the group sessions, Claire finds that there are conflicting details from some of the surviving passengers against the official statement of the airline, which is that it was pilot error that caused the crash, the pilot who is among the deceased and thus cannot defend himself. Claire wants to discover the truth behind the crash if only to help the survivors heal properly. In trying to discover the truth, Claire begins to butt heads with Mr. Arkin, the airline representative who she does not trust, especially as he seems to be following her. Also following her and the other survivors is an unknown man. As such, Claire also begins to believe the conspiracy theory of one of the survivors that the airline is trying to get to them to shut them up, permanently if need be, that unknown man suspected to work for Arkin. That theory is strengthened in Claire's mind as one by one, those surviving passengers stop attending the group therapy sessions, she not knowing where they are. Through it all, a kindly neighbor seems to be able to provide Claire with extra comfort during this time, like Eric she who seems to know what she needs without her asking.", "By some miracle, five extremely lucky passengers of a commercial airliner manage to survive a devastating emergency landing. Still unable to come to terms with their horrible experience, the fortunate commuters are entrusted in the capable hands of the dedicated trauma therapist, Claire, whose sessions attempt to shed light on their conflicting memories. Right from the start, Eric, one of Claire's seemingly less-traumatised patients, clearly stands out. Is it because of his amazing ability to overcome this disaster, or is it because Eric may be a part of a dark and well-planned conspiracy?"]}, {"movie_id": "tt9169658", "movie_title": "Emergence", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2I3NDBlODktNjhlMy00MWQ3LWFhMzEtZWJhYzk3OGI0MGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["A police chief investigates a case involving a young child found near the site of a mysterious accident."]}, {"movie_id": "tt0120685", "movie_title": "Godzilla", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFlOTI2OGQtMzg0YS00ZGE4LTkwMjEtZDUzYThlOTU5YjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["French nuclear tests irradiate an iguana into a giant monster that heads off to New York City.

And two decades after its unforgettable climax, it continues to fascinate, polarize, and even, yes, develop new chapters. Now, the producers of ESPN's award-winning \"30 for 30\" have made it the subject of their first documentary-event and most ambitious project yet. From Peabody and Emmy-award winning director Ezra Edelman, it's \"O.J.: Made in America,\" a 10-hour multi-part production coming summer of 2016. To most observers, it's a story that began the night Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were brutally murdered outside her Brentwood apartment. But as \"O.J.\" lays bare, to truly grasp the significance of what happened not just that night, but the epic chronicle to follow, one has to travel back to a much different, much earlier origin point, at not the end, but the beginning of the 20th century, when African-Americans began migrating to California en masse, in desperate, collective hope of a better life, trying desperately - and fruitlessly - to outrun the racism that had defined their lives. And among the thousands who came west from the south were the grandparents of Orenthal James Simpson. The tale is familiar from there. In the mid-1960's, Simpson rose to instant fame as an unstoppable running back for the USC Trojans, and later, not just a record-setting Hall of Famer in the NFL, but a crossover, charismatic superstar with a singular foothold in the celebrity landscape. In retirement, O.J. remained as popular as any active athlete - a broadcaster, pitch-man, and actor. But he stood alone for another reason as well. Living in the shadows of everything from the Civil Rights Movement to the Rodney King riots and so much in between, in a country forever divided by racial lines and a city with a horrific legacy of institutionalized police racism, O.J. Simpson managed always to find a way to transcend the color of his skin. That is, until everything changed on that June night of 1994. \"O.J.\" revisits - and redefines - it all. The domestic abuse. The police investigation. The white Bronco chase. The trial of the century. The motive, the blood, the glove. The verdict. The aftermath. Drawing upon more than seventy interviews- from longtime friends and colleagues of Simpson to the recognizable protagonists of the murder investigation to observers and commentators with distinct connections to the story - the docu-event is an engrossing, compelling, and unforgettable look at a tantalizing saga. Because at the end of what seems like a search for the real truth about O.J. Simpson, what's revealed just as powerfully is a collection of indelible, unshakeable, and haunting truths about America, and about ourselves."]}, {"movie_id": "tt15325794", "movie_title": "Fall", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI3MWYwYjItNzZhYi00ZWIzLTkyMzYtN2JmNjg3ODg1NTg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMwMDA5ODU3.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["Best friends Becky and Hunter find themselves at the top of a 2,000-foot radio tower.", "Drowning in a sea of grief, 51 painful weeks after the life-altering incident that scarred her for life, emotionally fragile rock climber Becky reluctantly decides to confront her fears.

The success of last season has changed the attitudes of the Indians. Pitching sensation Ricky \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn is now a yuppie who feels like he's lost his edge on his fastball. Homerun hitter Pedro Cerrano underwent a spiritual conversion, from aggressive voodoo to placid Buddhism, and his batting has declined. Roger Dorn retired and has replaced Rachel Phelps as the owner of the team. Catcher Jake Taylor has also retired to become one of the coaches who work for manager Lou Brown. Willie Mays Hayes is still as fast as ever, but he has added some power to his hitting. The Indians get off to another slow start, then Roger makes a big move by signing arrogant power hitting catcher Jack Parkman, who is a bully. Also, minor league catcher Rube Baker is called up to the Indians, even though Rube has a throwing problem. The signing of Jack Parkman has put Roger in a financially tough spot, so Roger later trades Jack to the Chicago White Sox, the team that stopped the Indians from going to the World Series last season. In return, the Indians have received left fielder Isuro Tanaka, who is a gifted fielder. Roger then sells the team back to Rachel Phelps, because Roger needs the money. Rachel sees this as an opportunity to get revenge on the Indians for what happened last season, so she tries to find ways to make them have a losing season this time. When Lou suffers a heart attack, he convinces Jake to take over as the Indians' substitute manager. Jake leads the Indians to their second consecutive division title, and another shot at the ALCS and their opponents are again the Chicago White Sox.

Lila felt Moses would be well suited to the job because of running within \"the\" crowd at Berkeley, even if only knowing the main players by name and reputation. Flyers have been circulating with a doctored photo of Hawthorne and Howard Eppis in a friendly embrace, Eppis who in the late 1960s was part of the California 4 - the other three being Michael and Wendy Linker, and Luis Vasquez - an anti-establishment group convicted of several counts related to their work against the government. While the Linkers are behind bars probably for the rest of their lives, Luis Vasquez is a free man working for the rights of Mexican laborers, while Eppis has been a fugitive ever since, the authorities who are still looking for him. The flyers, which contain extreme socialist rhetoric and an implication of Hawthorne welcoming Eppis' endorsement, have the potential to derail Hawthorne's campaign. Moses is tasked with finding out who is behind the flyers - the most obvious being the campaign of Hawthorne's competitor, Senator Dillworthy - and if it is indeed not Eppis, why they would have specifically used Eppis' name. Moses accepts the job despite not endorsing Hawthorne - or Dillworthy for that matter - he equating Hawthorne's excitement factor to watching paint dry. The further Moses and Lila get into the investigation, the number of unanswered questions they have grows, and the more people who were associated with Eppis at the time cannot be located, including Oscar Procari, Jr., who funded the California 4's defense probably to spite his industrialist father. With the many trails, Moses and Lila still believe finding Eppis would answer many questions. All the while, Moses tries to rekindle a relationship with Lila.

But there is a \"but\" in Simon's life, the big secret that he's been keeping now for a few years: he's gay and in the closet to everyone. He knows especially his parents would be all right with his homosexual orientation, despite Jack's often politically incorrect jokes, and that most of the students accept Ethan, their one and only openly gay classmate, but Simon has failed to come out for various reasons, mostly having to do with the change that would occur in what he has known as his life. He discovers that he is not alone: another classmate calling himself \"Blue\" (a pseudonym) is posting online about his own gay struggles in the closet. With that posting having an email address where one can respond, Simon begins an anonymous correspondence with Blue opening up about his own struggles. In the support they end up providing each other, Simon begins to fall for Blue not even knowing who he is. As Simon tries to figure out who Blue is, he starts to see his classmates in a new light.
