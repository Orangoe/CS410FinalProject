Will Lucy unlock the secrets of the fully operational human mind?", "Lucy, a young American woman living in Taipei, knows that she's in trouble when her casual boyfriend of a few weeks, Richard, a man she doesn't really know well, handcuffs a locked briefcase, contents unknown, to her wrist, forcing her to deliver it to a Mr. Jang in his swanky hotel suite. A scared Lucy quickly learns that Mr. Jang is a drug kingpin who is not averse to killing anyone in carrying out his work. That encounter with Mr. Jang leads to Lucy being forced to act as one of his drug mules, specifically of a powerful, synthetic drug called CPH4. Things start to change for Lucy when she inadvertently absorbs a high dose of CPH4 into her system, leading to several physiological changes to her self, most notably in that she begins to use more and more of her cerebral matter than the usual ten percent of most humans. As Lucy becomes more and more aware of everything around her - a result of the drug - she embarks on two concurrent paths, one being to get back at Mr. Jang and his associates for what they've done to her, including the torture they've inflicted on her. But the other path may trump the first, that second path which includes retrieving the CPH4 from the three other drug mules. It also involves Dr. Samuel Norman, arguably the foremost evolutionary theorist, and Paris Police Captain Pierre Del Rio, the later her touchstone to humanity, that need for a touchstone which becomes more and more important as she approaches her end goal."]}, {"movie_id": "tt2908446", "movie_title": "The Divergent Series: Insurgent", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxOTYxMTg3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgyMzA2NDE@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["Beatrice Prior must confront her inner demons and continue her fight against a powerful alliance which threatens to tear her society apart with the help from others on her side.", "As she searches for allies and answers in the wake of the uprising, Tris and Four are on the run.

Claire suspects that Eric may hold all the answers and becomes determined to uncover the truth, no matter the consequences.", "Dr. Claire Summers, a therapist, has lived her life within a small comfort zone without taking any risks. It is because of that life that her mentor Perry, to get her out of that comfort zone, assigns her to act as the group therapist for a handful of airplane crash survivors, that handful out of just over one hundred passengers who did not survive the crash. Perry warns her especially about one survivor, Eric Clark, who, instead of grief, feels ecstatic about life. Indeed, Eric does not want to attend group sessions along with the others, but he does encourage Claire to come see him anytime as a friend in his personal interest in her. On the caveat that he no longer hit on her, Claire decides to do so in her effort to help him. As such, she has to tread that fine line of acting but not acting as his therapist while he still has that attraction to her. Her ulterior motive in seeing Eric is that he, without coming right out and saying so or why, seems to know small details of her personal life. In the group sessions, Claire finds that there are conflicting details from some of the surviving passengers against the official statement of the airline, which is that it was pilot error that caused the crash, the pilot who is among the deceased and thus cannot defend himself. Claire wants to discover the truth behind the crash if only to help the survivors heal properly. In trying to discover the truth, Claire begins to butt heads with Mr. Arkin, the airline representative who she does not trust, especially as he seems to be following her. Also following her and the other survivors is an unknown man. As such, Claire also begins to believe the conspiracy theory of one of the survivors that the airline is trying to get to them to shut them up, permanently if need be, that unknown man suspected to work for Arkin. That theory is strengthened in Claire's mind as one by one, those surviving passengers stop attending the group therapy sessions, she not knowing where they are. Through it all, a kindly neighbor seems to be able to provide Claire with extra comfort during this time, like Eric she who seems to know what she needs without her asking.", "By some miracle, five extremely lucky passengers of a commercial airliner manage to survive a devastating emergency landing. Still unable to come to terms with their horrible experience, the fortunate commuters are entrusted in the capable hands of the dedicated trauma therapist, Claire, whose sessions attempt to shed light on their conflicting memories. Right from the start, Eric, one of Claire's seemingly less-traumatised patients, clearly stands out. Is it because of his amazing ability to overcome this disaster, or is it because Eric may be a part of a dark and well-planned conspiracy?"]}, {"movie_id": "tt9169658", "movie_title": "Emergence", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2I3NDBlODktNjhlMy00MWQ3LWFhMzEtZWJhYzk3OGI0MGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["A police chief investigates a case involving a young child found near the site of a mysterious accident."]}, {"movie_id": "tt0120685", "movie_title": "Godzilla", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFlOTI2OGQtMzg0YS00ZGE4LTkwMjEtZDUzYThlOTU5YjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["French nuclear tests irradiate an iguana into a giant monster that heads off to New York City.

And two decades after its unforgettable climax, it continues to fascinate, polarize, and even, yes, develop new chapters. Now, the producers of ESPN's award-winning \"30 for 30\" have made it the subject of their first documentary-event and most ambitious project yet. From Peabody and Emmy-award winning director Ezra Edelman, it's \"O.J.: Made in America,\" a 10-hour multi-part production coming summer of 2016. To most observers, it's a story that began the night Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were brutally murdered outside her Brentwood apartment. But as \"O.J.\" lays bare, to truly grasp the significance of what happened not just that night, but the epic chronicle to follow, one has to travel back to a much different, much earlier origin point, at not the end, but the beginning of the 20th century, when African-Americans began migrating to California en masse, in desperate, collective hope of a better life, trying desperately - and fruitlessly - to outrun the racism that had defined their lives. And among the thousands who came west from the south were the grandparents of Orenthal James Simpson. The tale is familiar from there. In the mid-1960's, Simpson rose to instant fame as an unstoppable running back for the USC Trojans, and later, not just a record-setting Hall of Famer in the NFL, but a crossover, charismatic superstar with a singular foothold in the celebrity landscape. In retirement, O.J. remained as popular as any active athlete - a broadcaster, pitch-man, and actor. But he stood alone for another reason as well. Living in the shadows of everything from the Civil Rights Movement to the Rodney King riots and so much in between, in a country forever divided by racial lines and a city with a horrific legacy of institutionalized police racism, O.J. Simpson managed always to find a way to transcend the color of his skin. That is, until everything changed on that June night of 1994. \"O.J.\" revisits - and redefines - it all. The domestic abuse. The police investigation. The white Bronco chase. The trial of the century. The motive, the blood, the glove. The verdict. The aftermath. Drawing upon more than seventy interviews- from longtime friends and colleagues of Simpson to the recognizable protagonists of the murder investigation to observers and commentators with distinct connections to the story - the docu-event is an engrossing, compelling, and unforgettable look at a tantalizing saga. Because at the end of what seems like a search for the real truth about O.J. Simpson, what's revealed just as powerfully is a collection of indelible, unshakeable, and haunting truths about America, and about ourselves."]}, {"movie_id": "tt15325794", "movie_title": "Fall", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI3MWYwYjItNzZhYi00ZWIzLTkyMzYtN2JmNjg3ODg1NTg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMwMDA5ODU3.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["Best friends Becky and Hunter find themselves at the top of a 2,000-foot radio tower.", "Drowning in a sea of grief, 51 painful weeks after the life-altering incident that scarred her for life, emotionally fragile rock climber Becky reluctantly decides to confront her fears.

The success of last season has changed the attitudes of the Indians. Pitching sensation Ricky \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn is now a yuppie who feels like he's lost his edge on his fastball. Homerun hitter Pedro Cerrano underwent a spiritual conversion, from aggressive voodoo to placid Buddhism, and his batting has declined. Roger Dorn retired and has replaced Rachel Phelps as the owner of the team. Catcher Jake Taylor has also retired to become one of the coaches who work for manager Lou Brown. Willie Mays Hayes is still as fast as ever, but he has added some power to his hitting. The Indians get off to another slow start, then Roger makes a big move by signing arrogant power hitting catcher Jack Parkman, who is a bully. Also, minor league catcher Rube Baker is called up to the Indians, even though Rube has a throwing problem. The signing of Jack Parkman has put Roger in a financially tough spot, so Roger later trades Jack to the Chicago White Sox, the team that stopped the Indians from going to the World Series last season. In return, the Indians have received left fielder Isuro Tanaka, who is a gifted fielder. Roger then sells the team back to Rachel Phelps, because Roger needs the money. Rachel sees this as an opportunity to get revenge on the Indians for what happened last season, so she tries to find ways to make them have a losing season this time. When Lou suffers a heart attack, he convinces Jake to take over as the Indians' substitute manager. Jake leads the Indians to their second consecutive division title, and another shot at the ALCS and their opponents are again the Chicago White Sox.

Lila felt Moses would be well suited to the job because of running within \"the\" crowd at Berkeley, even if only knowing the main players by name and reputation. Flyers have been circulating with a doctored photo of Hawthorne and Howard Eppis in a friendly embrace, Eppis who in the late 1960s was part of the California 4 - the other three being Michael and Wendy Linker, and Luis Vasquez - an anti-establishment group convicted of several counts related to their work against the government. While the Linkers are behind bars probably for the rest of their lives, Luis Vasquez is a free man working for the rights of Mexican laborers, while Eppis has been a fugitive ever since, the authorities who are still looking for him. The flyers, which contain extreme socialist rhetoric and an implication of Hawthorne welcoming Eppis' endorsement, have the potential to derail Hawthorne's campaign. Moses is tasked with finding out who is behind the flyers - the most obvious being the campaign of Hawthorne's competitor, Senator Dillworthy - and if it is indeed not Eppis, why they would have specifically used Eppis' name. Moses accepts the job despite not endorsing Hawthorne - or Dillworthy for that matter - he equating Hawthorne's excitement factor to watching paint dry. The further Moses and Lila get into the investigation, the number of unanswered questions they have grows, and the more people who were associated with Eppis at the time cannot be located, including Oscar Procari, Jr., who funded the California 4's defense probably to spite his industrialist father. With the many trails, Moses and Lila still believe finding Eppis would answer many questions. All the while, Moses tries to rekindle a relationship with Lila.

But there is a \"but\" in Simon's life, the big secret that he's been keeping now for a few years: he's gay and in the closet to everyone. He knows especially his parents would be all right with his homosexual orientation, despite Jack's often politically incorrect jokes, and that most of the students accept Ethan, their one and only openly gay classmate, but Simon has failed to come out for various reasons, mostly having to do with the change that would occur in what he has known as his life. He discovers that he is not alone: another classmate calling himself \"Blue\" (a pseudonym) is posting online about his own gay struggles in the closet. With that posting having an email address where one can respond, Simon begins an anonymous correspondence with Blue opening up about his own struggles. In the support they end up providing each other, Simon begins to fall for Blue not even knowing who he is. As Simon tries to figure out who Blue is, he starts to see his classmates in a new light.

Once in Rome, Maximus wastes no time in making his presence known, and is soon involved in a plot to overthrow the emperor with his former-love Lucilla, Commodus' sister, after whom he lusts, and also the widowed mother of Lucius, heir to the empire after his uncle, and democratic-minded senator, Gracchus.", "A dying Marcus Aurelius plans to name his loyal and brave General Maximus as his successor in order to restore the power of the Roman Senate.

Maximus escapes execution, but is sold into slavery and is forced to become a gladiator. Eventually, Maximus and his fellow gladiators are sent to Rome to perform for Commodus. Through his bravery he wins over the masses and reveals his true identity, much to the chagrin of Commodus. Can Maximus use his newfound popularity to avenge Marcus Aurelius' death, or will Commodus be able to keep the throne?"]}, {"movie_id": "tt10676052", "movie_title": "Fantastic Four", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZiNmYwYWItNzg4ZC00ZGI5LTlmMjAtMzUyMjlkYzk2NmJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTE1NjY5Mg@@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["One of Marvel's most iconic families makes it to the big screen: the Fantastic Four."]}, {"movie_id": "tt12261776", "movie_title": "65", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY3Y2ZjMDEtMjY3NC00MTcwLWFhMDEtMjRhNTVlM2I3OTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA3MTg3NTgw.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["An astronaut crash lands on a mysterious planet only to discover he's not alone."]}, {"movie_id": "tt5108870", "movie_title": "Morbius", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA3N2Q0ZTAtODJjNy00MmQzLWJlMmItOGFmNDI0ODgxN2QwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM0NTUzNDIy.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["Biochemist Michael Morbius tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead.", "Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder, and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble.

They have rented a brownstone in Georgetown as a place to live during the shoot, after which Chris plans to take Regan to Europe until their new house in Los Angeles is constructed. Chris continually hears noises in the middle of the night emanating from the attic, which she assumes is nothing more than a small infestation of rats. Concurrently, Regan, who had been an even keeled child, is showing periodic signs of unusual behavior, such as hyperactivity, swearing, lying and lack of concentration. The GP, Dr. Klein, who can only surmise the symptoms are a manifestation of stress from the separation and temporary move to DC away from her home, diagnoses her condition, solely based on the symptoms, as hyperkinesia. Despite Dr. Klein and other physicians trying to determine and explain Regan's increasingly abnormal and bizarre behavior with scientific theories, Chris begins to believe that there is more at play, especially as Regan's behavior ultimately includes violence and acts of superhuman strength, which can only be classified as other worldly which Regan herself could not have directly caused on her own, such as the rat-less noises in the attic. Despite having no religious convictions, Chris is convinced that since there is some other worldly force overtaking Regan, a course of action is to have that force - the demon - exorcised from Regan's being. Who contacts her is Father Damien Karras - also an M.D. who acts as a psychiatric counselor for the Catholic church - who Chris for whatever reason had been drawn to as a person she has seen in the neighborhood. Father Karras is facing his own crisis of faith upon the recent death of his mother. He needs not only the permission of the church to proceed but also his own faith that whatever he does will help as opposed to hurt Regan. Who the church also sends is Father Lankester Merrin, who may have a better understanding of what has possessed Regan and why it has chosen her, which is necessary to be able to combat it. The questions become whether Fathers Merrin and Karras have a strong enough faith to exorcise the demon and what they are willing to do to achieve their mission.", "More and more, Regan, the otherwise happy twelve-year-old daughter of the successful actress, Chris MacNeil, is showing signs of erratic and disturbing behaviour, after an ill-advised contact with the supernatural. As a result, as the situation is rapidly getting out of hand, with perfectly healthy Regan becoming increasingly violent and obscene, desperate Chris is willing to do everything in her power to keep her child safe, including seeking spiritual help. Now, Chris' only hope rests on the inexperienced Greek-American Catholic priest, Father Damien Karras, and the weary exorcist, Father Lankester Merrin, to perform the intricate purification rite that will rid Regan of the malevolent spirit that is tormenting her. But, can they confront the embodiment of evil?", "Accompanied by her 12 year-old daughter Regan, actress Chris McNeil relocates to Washington D.C. where she is filming a movie.

As Regan's situation reaches crisis proportions - she has to be tied to her bed, swears like a sailor and speaks in tongues - Chris turns to Father Karras, a Roman Catholic priest and psychiatrist to see if an exorcism might be the solution to their problem.

Indeed, John is caught between a rock and a hard place, and as if that weren't enough, the svelte and sophisticated nouveau-riche heiress, Frances Stevens, is on to him. But, who could be the real culprit? Above all, what will it take to catch a thief?", "There have been a swath of cat burglaries of expensive jewelry, the burglaries all along the French Riviera resort towns. The police believe the burglaries have been committed by ex-con John Robie - nicknamed \"the cat\" - the burglaries hallmark of his M.O. Robie's old associates, most who have gone the straight and narrow in working for one of their own, Bertani, in his restaurant, believe it's Robie, which they don't like in guilt by former association pointed in their direction. The overall belief that it's Robie is despite he having been a hero for the French Resistance during the war, he and his former cat burglary associates paroled for that war effort. Robie, who lives a comfortable life as an amateur horticulturalist in a seaside villa, asserts he hasn't cat burgled since before working for the Resistance. As such, he feels that he has no other option but to catch the burglar himself. He believes it has to be someone who knows him or could have learned the details of his former burglaries, such as someone who worked for the local police before the war. In doing so, he will have to think like the cat burglar in anticipating his next targets and catching him in the act. In the process, two women pursue him romantically. One is Danielle Foussard, the daughter of one of his former associates - the current wine steward at the restaurant - she who wants him to see her as a woman and not the child he knew. The other is Francie Stevens, an American socialite vacationing with her mother, Jessie Stevens, who is top of the list as the burglar's next target. Francie's pursuit of Robie is seemingly to add a little excitement in her life as he, cat burglar or not, has that sense of danger unlike most of the men she dates at home. Robie, Francie and Danielle may be placed in mortal danger either at the hands of his former associates who may want to get rid of him in only turning down the unwanted spotlight on them, at the hands of the authorities in Robie, Francie and/or Danielle being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or the real new cat burglar if they get too close to discovering the truth.", "A series of ingenious jewelry robberies takes place on the French Riviera.

Living with the devil?\" Rebecca (1940) by Robert E.

Themes of class, servitude, romance, and jealousy seem to dominate the narrative of this fish-out-of-water, whirlwind romance that hastily moves the awkward and nervous new bride (Joan Fontaine) into the fully-staffed seaside mansion \"Manderley\" of her paternalistic new husband, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). It's clear early on and all throughout the story, that the new bride's name is meant to be obscured, as she is only referred to and addressed as \"the young bride,\" \"madam,\" \"the child,\" \"darling,\" and \"dear.\" She meets the refined household staff, most of whom are gracious and welcoming, but quickly discovers that the stiff and formal, housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), does not approve of her. Mrs. Danvers is quite overt in her determination to psychologically bully the new Mrs. de Winter into thinking that the house (especially the west wing) should stay just as the greatly \"adored\" Rebecca left it (prior to drowning a year ago) and overtly convinces the new bride that her husband still loves his former wife. Mrs. Danvers' behavior in addition to Maxim's outbursts, persistent distancing, and uncertainty about their marriage increase the new Mrs. de Winter's nervousness and clinginess. At mid-point, the new bride finally asserts that Rebecca's belongings should be removed, and she desperately tries to convince Maxim that they are happily married. At the heart of this story is a trifecta of psychological instability. The seemingly \"broken\" Maxim is reeling from the death of Rebecca, not because he misses her, but because he feels responsible for her death. The easily pleased, new Mrs. de Winter, believes she is in love with the man she married and hardly knows (and has no family of her own), so she is terribly desperate to make their relationship work. The openly hostile Mrs. Danvers is so fiercely loyal to her former mistress and so wholly disillusioned about Maxim's grief, that she has no qualms about pushing Maxim's new wife to the brink of suicide. What's especially clever (and ominous) about Rebecca is that each of the main characters is being driven mad by the title character we never get to see. When considering the extreme and tragic ending in relation to the set-up and second act development, I think the overall presentation would have been better served by spending less time establishing the short courtship and more time building up Mrs. Danver's rapidly evolving insanity.", "Maxim de Winter (Sir Laurence Olivier), still troubled by the death of his first wife Rebecca, falls in love with a shy ladies' companion.

Joseph, the favored son of the patriarch Jacob, was given into captivity by his own envious brothers. A tireless and highly productive worker, Joseph wins his master's trust and is named steward of Potiphar's household. However, Joseph also unwittingly arouses the lust of Potiphar's wife. Luring him into her room one day, she orders Joseph to give her pleasure. But Joseph prefers punishment, even death, to betraying his master. As he flees from the room, the desperate woman tears off Joseph's garment and brandishes it as proof of her violation. As Potiphar questions him, Joseph begins to narrate the story of his past, a tale of suffering and hardship. We flash back to the time when Jacob and his family settled near the town of Schechem. It is a brief and unhappy stay, for when Jacob's daughter Dinah is ravished by the young prince of Schechem, Jacob's sons decide to exact revenge with a bloodbath - despite an agreement reached between Jacob and the Schechemites. As Jacob and his family flee, Rachel, Jacob's beloved wife, dies while giving birth to Benjamin. A few years elapse, and Jacob's older sons become increasingly resentful of their father's preference for Joseph. When Joseph turns seventeen, his father has a wonderful colored coat made for him, which further excites the jealousy of the brothers. When Joseph is sent to a distant pasture one day to look after his brothers, they seize him, tear off his coat, throw him into a dry well and, the following day, sell him as a slave to traders on their way to Egypt. This is how he enters the service of Potiphar. Despite his doubts about his wife's version of the \"rape\", Potiphar has Joseph jailed to vindicate his wife publicly. In prison, Joseph is assigned to attend two high court officials who are suspected of having stolen a bracelet from the Pharaoh. Tormented by dreams, the men ask Joseph for help. Joseph tells the cup-bearer that he will be reinstated, and the chief-baker that he will hang. Two years later, the cup-bearer remembers Joseph when the Pharaoh is unable to obtain from his priests a rational interpretation of two anguishing dreams. Joseph is summoned and predicts that after seven years of plentiful harvest, Egypt will suffer seven years of famine. Convinced, the Pharaoh appoints Joseph as his chancellor and gives him a beautiful Egyptian woman as his wife. Joseph immediately begins to put aside a fifth of the country's harvest. After seven years a murderous famine strikes, driving people from nations near and far to come to Egypt to buy grain. Among the famished, Joseph recognizes his brothers. Testing them to see if they have changed, Joseph is satisfied and reveals his identity. Finally reunited with his beloved brother Benjamin and his father Jacob, Joseph reconciles with his family, and the Pharaoh invites them to settle in Egypt as overseers of his livestock."]}, {"movie_id": "tt0361693", "movie_title": "Happy Endings", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2UxMzI0ZmEtNTA0Yy00NTQ2LWEyM2MtNTRlNTM4OTkyNzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["Happy Endings weaves multiple stories to create a witty look at love, family and the sheer unpredictability of life itself.", "Three stories of Angelenos linked linearly by people associated with each are told.

The Christians, who do not recognize his divinity, are a thorn in his side, and he is having them cruelly persecuted. The small village in Asia Minor, to which the aged apostle John has withdrawn, is also attacked by Roman soldiers. As if by a miracle, John is the only person to escape the slaughter, and he receives divine orders to write down the visions he will have, and communicate them to the Christian communities in the Roman provinces of Asia. The voice tells him that they should discover what is and what will happen thereafter. Among the Christians of Asia Minor, who believe that John is dead, everyone is deeply worried about being persecuted. Gaius, the community elder in Smyrna, is concerned that only a few believers still dare come to the ritual supper. Under these circumstances, Christianity can no longer exist. But at this point, the young Irene appears at the secret meeting. She is convinced that John, who could give the Christians back their courage, is still alive, because a certain Theophilus, who is being held captive by the Romans on the island of Patmos, is in contact with him, and had a letter sent to her. In it, John describes his vision of Heaven: And behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and one sat on the throne, and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne a book that was sealed with seven seals. Neither Gaius, nor the other adult believers, understand what John means by this. Only a little child among them, also named John, grasps the sense of it: John realizes that the throne belongs to God, and sees the seven lamps of fire as the seven Christian communities of Asia Minor, together with the four elements and the book of seals with the mystery of faith that brings salvation. Yet the letter's mysterious origins make Gaius skeptical. He is only prepared to believe in the integrity of this vision, if John really is still alive. Old Theophilus, who in reality is John himself, has been sent to the prison island of Patmos, ruled by the corrupt Roman official Corvus, as a scribe, while the other prisoners have to do hard labor in the mines. Many of them hate Theophilus (John) because of the special treatment he is receiving, but above all, because he is a Christian. Nevertheless, he does succeed in converting some of his fellow prisoners to Christianity, such as the young scribe Demetrius, who is planning to escape along a secret tunnel. When the shaken John tells his companions about the crucifixion of the Savior, they realize that he was there at the time, and is actually John. He falls into a trance and experiences a new vision of Heaven: And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes. And he came and took the book. And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. Meanwhile, in Smyrna, the young Irene has taken her leave of Valerius, whom she loves with a pure heart. She does not realize that he is not a Christian at all, but a spy working for the notoriously brutal Roman general Rufus, who has been ordered by Domitian to persecute Christians in Asia Minor. Valerius is a Roman soldier, born as a slave, he has his foster-father Rufus to thank for everything he has now become. He therefore has to obey when Rufus sends him to Patmos. Disguised as a prisoner, Valerius is told to find out whether John is still alive, because there are incessant rumors that he is, and they are leading to unwelcome solidarity among the Christians. Meanwhile Irene, with the help of her brother Jonicus, who visits Patmos regularly as a trader, gains access to the prison camp there. She recognizes Valerius from a distance and gets very worried about him. She embarked on all these dangers for the sake of John. However, her greatest desire is to see the last living Apostle, and to tell everyone about him. John trusts her, and confides in her under the seal of secrecy. She receives his visions in written form and promises to circulate the text among the Christians. Meanwhile on Patmos, Valerius tries to gain the trust of the Christian prisoners by defending the old Sostenes against the guards and suffering severe punishment as a result. Bound to a cross, he is left in the burning sunshine, but John is the only one who dares give him any water. And to Valerius' great surprise, he seems to know all about him and Rufus. In the hell of the prison camp, where violence and resentment reign, John often wonders about his mission: why has the Lord trapped him on this island, instead of sending him out into the world to spread the glad tidings? Then, surrounded by his companions, he falls into a trance, and again he sees himself in Heaven, with the Lamb on the throne. It is being threatened by a heavily armed knight on a red horse who is bringing hatred and war to humanity. Then a black horse appears whose rider is holding a pair of scales: he is the bringer of injustice and selfishness. Meanwhile, Rufus has ordered the island's governor Corvus to come and see him to tell him to show more severity, especially toward the Christians. Corvus is worried about losing his lucrative job, and so he tells his guards to be even more watchful than before. As a result, he notices that Irene has slipped into the camp again with Jonicus, to collect John's latest message. However, Jonicus cleverly manages to talk the guards out of searching either himself or his sister. John's visions become increasingly frequent and exhaust his strength. Nevertheless, Demetrius is still hoping to be able to get him off the island. The tunnel is ready, and the escape is planned for that evening. But when John supports the maltreated Sostenes, he incurs the wrath of the governor. He is imprisoned and the escape plans are scrapped. In his prison cell, John has a new vision: the Lamb breaks the fourth seal and again a horse appears, the pale horse that brings death into the world, plagues and famines, accidents and earthquakes. Only the love of God can defeat it. That night, numerous prisoners want to use the tunnel to escape, but it is discovered by the guards, and the fugitives are slaughtered. For Demetrius, all hope of rescue has now vanished. But John consoles him, telling him that it is God's will that they remain here on the island. Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven, Jesus announces to him in the vision. And then he sees a huge number of people in Heaven: They called in a loud voice: Salvation cometh from our God. The Christians of Asia Minor, all in very great danger, cling to this belief, for the Romans are murdering them all, women and men, young and old alike. Irene and Ionicus put their lives into very great danger and, with the help of a guard, manage to free John and the other Christians from the camp, the Roman spy Valerius among them. A ship is waiting at the harbor. But John is too old and weak to shake off the guards pursuing them. He takes his leave of his companions and hides in a cave together with Valerius, who is transformed by the old man's influence, and becomes his helper. In the cave, John goes into a prophetic trance and has his last vision: And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven. And I saw the seven angels which stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets. When the angels blew one after the other into the trumpets, hail, fire, and locusts destroyed the Earth, the sea turned to blood, darkness covered the Earth and the Day of Judgment arrived. And I saw a new heaven and a new Earth, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain. Meanwhile Irene, Jonicus and Demetrius are arrested by Corvus and his men, and Valerius and John are found in their cave, their lives are forfeited. But at this point, Rufus arrives, and not only frees his foster son Valerius, but also the other captive Christians. It turns out that the Emperor Domitian is dead, and his successor has announced an amnesty. The persecution of the Christians is over. John, his companions, and the Christian communities all thank God for their salvation. Freed from his duty toward his foster-father, Valerius is finally free to embrace his beloved Irene."]}, {"movie_id": "tt2139965", "movie_title": "Hang Loose", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NjQ2ODQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc1OTQ2OA@@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["Kevin must go to Hawaii to attend the wedding of his big sister.

The widowed Reverend John Ruthledge administered at the church and the guiding light referred to a lamp he had in his study that always remained lit for his parishioners and anyone to seek comfort at the non-denominational church. In the late 1940s, the show (still on radio) moved to the fictional suburb of Los Angeles, California, \"Selby Flats\", when Reverend Ruthledge's daughter, Mary, and her husband Ned Holden (who at one time was Reverend Ruthledge's adopted son), took the \"guiding light\" lamp to Reverend Ruthledge's friend and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Reverend Charles Matthews.

The show premiered on television in black-and-white and live (until 1969) on June 30, 1952.

The \"The\" of \"Guiding Light\" was dropped about a year before it went to an hour.

He finds their budget meager and pointless without shooter skills, hence suggests they hire men for the job instead. He's persuaded to assemble a team for the relative pittance, which surprisingly amounts to seven in need of income, including self-invited Chico, whose farm boy kills prove as useful. The village is fitted with defenses and the men are given basic training. the element of surprise prevails at unsuspecting Calvera's first attack, but his sworn revenge sounds daunting for many villagers to reconsider their commitment, now obviously to the death, while knaves and even females are drawn into the effort, adding to the seven's motivation.", "A remake of \"The Seven Samurai\": Seven men are picked to defend a Mexican village from banditos that come every now and then to take whatever the town has grown since their last visit. When they are hired, they go to the town and teach the villagers how to defend themselves. When the leader of the bandits comes, they fight off him and his men. The second time he comes, the villagers give the seven to them, due to a heated argument. The leader of the bandits takes their guns and throws them out of town. He gives them horses and gives their guns back to them when they are far out of town. The seven decide that they aren't going to run, and head back to the village for a final showdown."]}, {"movie_id": "tt0083780", "movie_title": "Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds", "movie_poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzViZDg3Y2ItMTZkZS00MDliLTkyNzYtZDdiZTY5ZTBkZmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjExODE1MDc@.jpg", "movie_storyLines": ["In 17th century France, young Dogtanian travels to Paris to fulfill his ambition to become one of the King's Musketeers.

Although Christina officially owns it - she bringing it into their marriage as part of her dowry - Michel effectively makes all the decisions, partly because he wants to show everyone involved that he is in control as the man, and as Christina is a frail woman with a delicate constitution, the primary problem being a weak heart. Their marriage has long been over because of Michel's brutish behavior toward her, although Christina, a devout Catholic, refuses to get a divorce. Michel has openly been having an affair with Nicole Horner, one of the teachers at the school. But even now their relationship is on the rocks as Michel beats her. Nicole convinces Christina that their collective problems can all be solved if they kill Michel. Nicole hatches an elaborate plan to take place over a long weekend: she and Christina will drive down to her house in Niort for the weekend, while Michel is stuck at the school; Christina will make up some ruse for Michel to come to Niort; they will drug and then drown him in Nicole's bathtub; they will then transport the body back to the school before the end of the weekend, dumping the body into the school's murky outdoor pool; the dead body will eventually rise to the surface and thus be discovered. With the successful execution of the plan, Nicole and Christina will have an alibi of being away for the weekend when he would have died by accidentally drowning in the pool. With a few required modifications and a few hiccups along the way, the latter largely due to Christina often losing her nerve, they are able to carry out the plan successfully, or so they believe. However, the body never materializes in the pool, even after the pool is emptied on a pretense.

The result was a documentary that drew excellent reviews, following a screening at the 1971 New York Film Festival and a television broadcast. It was later withdrawn from circulation because of legal rights. It was only in early 2006 that Bogdanovich - who was reportedly never totally happy with the 1971 version - went back and revamped the documentary to his satisfaction. He recorded totally new interviews with Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg and incorporated a rare audio recording of Ford and his rumored 'significant other' Katharine Hepburn. He has integrated these new elements alongside the strongest sections from the first version - including extended interviews with Ford and collaborators such as John Wayne, Richard Widmark, James Stewart and Henry Fonda.
